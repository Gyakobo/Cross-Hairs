This is a project which I presented for the 2021 Hackathon @ NJIT  

>[!WARNING]
>This project is very raw and indelicate, and honestly could be furnished a bit more. Most prominently I want to point out that I should have definitely utilized `malloc` and allocated and managed memory way more efficiently. Apart from that there's a ton of memory leaks and code errors.

## Introduction

To start off, I always had a passion for mathematics, physics and programming. The world always seemed quantifiable and boring to me, thus I always reverted to coding. I specifically loved exploiting game and physics engines. Making up glamorous formulas predicting the gravitational trajectory of an object always fascinated me. Having heard of the Hackathon, I was sort of pushed into making my own physics from scratch.

This project tries to simulate fluid dynamics, and fluid viscosity.
